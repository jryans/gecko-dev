/**
 * The resources API is focused around discovery of "types", such as frames, workers,
 * processes, etc. The resources front provides access to each type separately, such as
 * `resources.frames.<method>`. For each supported type, the following methods are
 * available:
 *
 * find(filters = {}) â†’
 * { results: Array of <type> actors, targets: Array of <type> targets }
 * Find all of the <type> things in this target and all supplemental targets that descend
 * from it. filters may be added for more precise control where as needed, such as only
 * looking in the current target, process, etc. Additionally, targets are created for
 * those that are remote from this target.
 *
 * query(({ target }) => { ... })
 * Run a callback for each of the <type> things in this target and all supplemental
 * targets that descend from it.
 *
 * listen(filters = {}, handler)
 * Listen for added and removed events. Actor uses ref counting to stop listening at the
 * platform layer when all clients have unlistened.
 *
 * unlisten(filters = {}, handler)
 * Stop listening for added and removed events. Actor uses ref counting to stop listening
 * at the platform layer when all clients have unlistened.
 *
 * added event
 * Emitted when a <type> is added. An object with additional details is also emitted. If
 * there is a related target, that is included as the target property.
 *
 * removed event
 * Emitted when a <type> is removed. An object with additional details is also emitted. If
 * there is a related target, that is included as the target property. In the case of a
 * frame that is reassigned to a new process, the sequence of removed and added will be
 * emitted.
